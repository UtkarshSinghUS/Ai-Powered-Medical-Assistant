  - **Diagnosis**: CBC test, blood cultures, chest X-rays.
  - **Treatment**: Antipyretics (paracetamol), hydration, and rest.

- **Symptom**: Chest Pain
  - **Types**:
    - **Cardiac**: Angina, myocardial infarction.
    - **Non-cardiac**: GERD, costochondritis.
  - **Tests**: ECG, echocardiogram, stress test, endoscopy.
  - **Treatment**: Depends on cause; nitroglycerin for angina, antacids for GERD.

#### Section 3: Medications
- **Analgesics**: 
  - Acetaminophen: For mild to moderate pain.
  - Ibuprofen: For pain and inflammation.
- **Antibiotics**: 
  - Amoxicillin: Broad-spectrum antibiotic.

- **Antidepressants**: 
  - SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline): For depression and anxiety.

#### Section 4: Diagnostic Tools
- **Blood Tests**:
  - CBC: Evaluates red and white blood cells, platelets.
  - HbA1c: Monitors long-term glucose levels for diabetics.
- **Imaging**:
  - MRI: Soft tissue imaging for brain, spine, joints.
  - X-Ray: Bone fractures, chest infections.
  - Ultrasound: Pregnancy monitoring, organ imaging.
